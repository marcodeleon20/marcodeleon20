## Experience

Throughout my journey, I have gained experience in developing compilers and frameworks. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. C++ Compiler using Bison and Flex: I developed a compiler using Bison and Flex tools for lexical and syntax analysis, respectively. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of compiler design and implementation in C++.

2. JavaScript Web Framework using Jison: I created a web framework using Jison, a JavaScript parser generator. This framework follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and provides a solid foundation for web application development.

## Goals

As a Systems Engineering student and an aspiring software developer, I have the following goals:

1. Dive deeper into learning emerging technologies and trends in software development.
2. Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the development community.
3. Improve my problem-solving skills and algorithm design abilities.
4. Participate in hackathons and programming competitions to challenge myself and keep learning.
